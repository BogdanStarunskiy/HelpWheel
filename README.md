The first tab automatically displays the weather conditions depending on the location of the user, or the user can specify the location in which he wants to know the weather 
at the moment. Therefore, thick fog or some other bad weather will not be a surprise for you.
 
In the notes, the user can write down the date of the last maintenance or repair, comments, instructions and other useful information. For example: indicate which works were 
performed, which spare parts were replaced, their cost, with the possibility of specifying the address of the online store where they were purchased, the next interval of 
maintenance, etc.

The fuel manager is located on the third tab.
It is an indispensable tool for every driver, which is designed to make such a routine activity as refueling more convenient and to calculate whether you have enough fuel 
to get to your destination or have to stop at a "pit stop". Its interface consists of several blocks. In the highest block is the final amount of fuel, which is determined 
automatically from the user's data on his car. In the lower blocks, the user is given statistics on fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. 
By clicking on the "+" button, the user calls up a menu where it is possible to plan a trip for the future, see the possible amount of fuel spent, funds to be spent and CO2
emissions into the atmosphere.
